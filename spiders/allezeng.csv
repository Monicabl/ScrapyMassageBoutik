,
,Le taping s'est imposé en France comme une méthode de soin particuliè rement efficace et rapide des lésions musculaires, ligamentaires ou tendineuses ainsi que des troubles lymphatiques. Cependant, son utilisation et sa mise en oeuvre nécessitent des connaissances précises ; cet ouvrage détaille ainsi, de manière pédagogique et adaptée, la physiologie du taping et ses différentes applications. L'auteur décrit dans une première partie les principes de bases du taping. Il aborde ensuite les techniques de pose habituelles - techniques musculaires, lymphatiques, ligamentaires et de correction posturale - et y ajoute la description de techniques spécifiques comme les montages sur les cicatrices, les trajets nerveux ou les segments, les techniques de correction des fascias, les techniques agissant sur les trigger points et les techniques énergétiques. Les applications cliniques sont ensuite détaillées dans une troisième partie, aussi bien dans les domaines orthopédiques et chirurgicaux qu'en médecine interne, en gynécologie ou en neurologie. L'ouvrage s'appuie sur plus de 740 photographies pour décrire ces techniques. L'atout majeur de ce guide est le body painting étape par étape : - en se basant sur le célèbre Atlas d'anatomie Sobotta, les structures anatomiques ont été peintes avec une grande précision sur le corps d'un modèle ; - les bandes sont alors appliquées sur ces « structures anatomiques sous-jacentes » ; - des explications pas à pas détaillent enfi n chaque étape de cette application, donnant ainsi une vision parfaitement claire et précise de la localisation des bandes. Les vidéos de la version originale sont accessibles en ligne, elles permettent de visualiser la pose des bandes pour assimiler parfaitement ces techniques. Cet ouvrage, véritable guide de référence en langue française sur le sujet, est destiné aux kinésithérapeutes ainsi qu'aux médecins du sport, ostéopathes, préparateurs sportifs et podologues. ",https://www.allezhousses.com/en/books-charts-and-reflexology/713-tapingtechniques-effets-applic-cliniques-9782294747311.html,new,CAD$116.95,In Stock,https://www.allezhousses.com/2996-large_default/tapingtechniques-effets-applic-cliniques.jpg,,9782294747311,

,Depuis 25 ans, l'Atlas d'anatomie humaine Netter est l'atlas de référence internationale. Le succès de cet ouvrage réside dans la qualité et la beauté du travail du Dr Netter.

De plus, le choix des couleurs, l'utilisation de la terminologie anatomique internationale, l'illustration par de nombreux clichés d'imagerie moderne (TDM et IRM) ainsi que des commentaires didactiques facilitent la compréhension et la mémorisation de l'anatomie humaine. L'ouvrage est divisé en huit sections, qui font chacune le tour complet d'une grande région anatomique. Cette 6e édition, entièrement révisée, s'enrichit d'une vingtaine de nouvelles planches d'anatomie et d'imagerie et plus de la moitié des planches ont été révisées (légendes, dessins). À la fin de chaque section, un tableau récapitulatif des muscles donne pour chacun d'eux : le détail de son attache proximale et distale, son innervation, ses principales actions, sa vascularisation artérielle ainsi que son appartenance aux groupes musculaires. Outre les compléments en ligne français planches à légender, QCM avec réponses commentées ainsi que 100 cas cliniques QCM cette nouvelle édition offre également l'accès à l'ensemble des compléments en ligne américains via le site Student Consult tridimensionnels (3D), vidéos de dissections, planches de dissections commentées ainsi que 54 planches supplémentaires.

966,Himalayan Salt Balls for massage,"
,
,
,Just as hot stone massage, the Himalayan salt balls massage first uses a classic massage technique such as Swedish or Californian, and then adds a touch of extra comfort through the use of previously heated salt balls. These Himalayan salt balls contain 84 minerals and nutrients that penetrate the superficial layers of the epidermis under the action of heat and massage oil. The balls can be used all over the body, except the face, or in order to relax muscles, target more tensed or tired areas according to the needs of the client. Salt balls can also be cooled down and target a more athletic care aimed at reducing inflammation.,
,Benefits,
,Combined with the therapist’s proceedings, the activity of salt balls allows a better blood circulation for the elimination of toxins and optimal relaxation in the body. This care also soothes tension, tones up muscles and stimulates reflex zones. Minerals in the salt balls help remineralize muscle attachments and joints, reduce pain and inflammation, and gently exfoliate the skin.,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,Proceedings,
,The therapist first prepares two or four Himalayan salt balls by heating them with a towel warmer or the microwave. The massage then follows its normal course, allowing the salt balls to assist the different movements. The salt balls can be used alone or with massage oil or essential oils. When the care is completed, it is a common practice for the client to leave with the salt balls in order to use them at home, for a massage or in a bath.,
,We strongly recommend to warm then up with the ,salt ball warmer.,
,Contraindications,
,This care is contraindicated for people with phlebitis or open wounds. Also, it is not recommended to roll the balls directly on the path of a protruding varix.,
